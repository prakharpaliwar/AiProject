# Image Classification with CNNs

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from datasets such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet, etc. We leverage advanced CNN architectures, including ResNet and EfficientNet, to explore the effectiveness of these models in image classification tasks. The project examines various aspects such as architecture choices, data augmentation, transfer learning, and the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of the models.

## Models Used
- **ResNet**: Originally designed by Microsoft, ResNet (Residual Network) introduces a novel architecture with "skip connections" allowing it to learn deeper neural networks.
- **EfficientNet**: Developed by Google, EfficientNet provides a scalable and efficient network that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy by balancing network depth, width, and resolution.

## Dataset
The models were trained and tested using the following datasets:
- **CIFAR-10**: Consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset consisting of over 14 million images labeled across over 20,000 categories.

## Key Concepts
- **CNN Architecture**: Discusses the structure of the CNNs used, including layers, activation functions, and why certain models were chosen.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques used to increase the diversity of the training set by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and cropping.

## Performance Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The effects of various hyperparameters, such as learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size, were also analyzed to understand their impact on the model's effectiveness.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- Details on the hyperparameter settings that were experimented with and their outcomes on the model performance.
- Explanation of how different configurations helped in achieving the optimal results.
